# Brain-Tumor-Detector
This project is a machine learning-based web application for detecting brain tumors from MRI images using classical SVM algorithms. It includes image preprocessing, model training, and deployment via Flask. The goal is to classify MRI scans into four categories: Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary, and No Tumor.
